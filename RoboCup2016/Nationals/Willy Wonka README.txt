Willy Wonka:
Willy Wonka has a hat that can spin, arms that move up and down and a piston mechanism which controls turning on and off a string of LEDs.

During the performance Willy Wonka looks over his factory and his hat and arms move at different times depending on the music. (When there is a "Whee" his hat spins and when there is a "Hooray!" his arms move.) When he goes crazy his hat and arms move at random times and at random speeds. At any time during the performance, I can press the button connected to the touch sensor which will either turn the lights on or off.
